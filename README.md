## Introduction

This Python script presents a text-based version of the classic Hangman game. In Hangman, the computer chooses a secret word, and the player's objective is to guess this word correctly within a limited number of attempts. The player guesses one letter at a time, and the script checks if the guessed letter is present in the secret word. If the guess is correct, the script reveals the positions of the guessed letter(s) in the word, providing a fun and interactive word-guessing experience for players.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
- Python

## Installation

Clone the repository or download the Python script to your local machine.

## Usage

To play the game follow these steps:
1. Run the Python script.
2. Enter a single letter when prompted.
3. The program will respond with "Good guess" for valid input or "Sorry, {letter} is not in the word. Try again" for invalid or incorrect input.
4. Continue to guess letters and uncover the secret word.
5. If you successfully guess the word, the program will display "Congratulations. You won the game!" If you run out of lives without guessing the word, it will display "You lost!"
